Teddy and Chuck communicated their findings with Bureau and local police. Marcus, who was considered as a second brother by Caesar was found to be a prime suspect. He was arrested based on following evidences:

> The conclusion of the detective duo inferred from clue 1 and clue 2.

> Marcus can be considered as an insider who can commit the murder without a break-in or struggle     with Caesar.

> His exposure to Caesarâ€™s sensitive works.

Upon questioning Marcus admitted his guilt.
Caesar and Marcus had developed some Cyber wares that had a wide range of applications. Caesar wanted to use that to help amputees but Marcus had negotiated with a weapons manufacturer to provide that technology for building weapons. This was opposed by Caesar. In order to work deals with weapons manufacturer, Caesar was killed by Marcus. This was the crimes's motive. Hence the case was closed successfully by the detective duo.
